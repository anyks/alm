## Project goals and features

The are many toolkits capable of creating language models: ([KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm), [SriLM](https://github.com/BitMindLab/SRILM), [IRSTLM](https://github.com/irstlm-team/irstlm)), and each of those toolkits may have a reason to exist. But our language model creation toolkit has the following goals and features:

- **UTF-8 support**: Full UTF-8 support without third-party dependencies.
- **Support of many data formats**: ARPA, Vocab, Map Sequence, N-grams, Binary alm dictionary.
- **Smoothing algorithms**: Kneser-Nay, Modified Kneser-Nay, Witten-Bell, Additive, Good-Turing, Absolute discounting.
- **Normalisation and preprocessing for corpora**: Transferring corpus to lowercase, smart tokenization, ability to create black - and white - lists for n-grams.
- **ARPA modification**: Frequencies and n-grams replacing, adding new n-grams with frequencies, removing n-grams.
- **Pruning**: N-gram removal based on specified criteria.
- **Removal of low-probability n-grams**: Removal of n-grams which backoff probability is higher than standard probability.
- **ARPA recovery**: Recovery of damaged n-grams in ARPA with subsequent recalculation of their backoff probabilities.
- **Support of additional word features**: Feature extraction: (numbers, roman numbers, ranges of numbers, numeric abbreviations, any other custom attributes) using scripts written in Python3.
- **Text preprocessing**: Unlike all other language model toolkits, ALM can extract correct context from files with unnormalized texts.
- **Unknown word token accounting**: Accounting of 〈unk〉 token as full n-gram.
- **Redefinition of 〈unk〉 token**: Ability to redefine an attribute of an unknown token.
- **N-grams preprocessing**: Ability to pre-process n-grams before adding them to ARPA using custom Python3 scripts.
- **Binary container for Language Models**: The binary container supports compression, encryption and installation of copyrights.
- **Convenient visualization of the Language model assembly process**: ALM implements several types of visualizations: textual, graphic, process indicator, and logging to files or console.
- **Collection of all n-grams**: Unlike other language model toolkits, ALM is guaranteed to extract all possible n-grams from the corpus, regardless of their length (except for Modified Kneser-Nay); you can also force all n-grams to be taken into account even if they occured only once.

#### Description:

- **oc** - Occurrence in corpus
- **dc** - Occurrence in documents
- **tf** - Term frequency — the ratio of a word occurrence to the total number of words in a document. Thus, the importance of a word is evaluated within a single document, calculation formula is: [tf = oc / cw]
- **idf** - Inverse document frequency for word, calculation formula: [idf = log(ad / dc)]
- **tf-idf** - It's calculated by the formula: [tf-idf = tf * idf]
- **wltf** - Word rating, calculation formula: [wltf = 1 + log(tf * dc)]

### The python script format to preprocess the received words
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def init():
    """
    Initialization Method: Runs only once at application startup
    """

def run(word, context):
    """
    Processing start method: starts when a word is extracted from text
    @word    word for processing
    @context sequence of previous words as an array
    """
    return word
```

---

### The python script format to define the word features
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def init():
    """
    Initialization Method: Runs only once at application startup
    """

def run(token, word):
    """
    Processing start method: starts when a word is extracted from text
    @token word token name
    @word  word for processing

    elif token and (token == "<russia>"):
        if word and (word.lower() == "russia"): return "ok"
    return "no"
```

---

### Environment variables

- All parameters can be passed through environment variables. Variables should begin with the prefix **ALM_** and must be written in upper case, their names should correspond to the application parameters.
- If both application parameters and environment variables are specified at the same time, application parameters will take precedence.

```bash
$ export ALM_SMOOTHING=wittenbell

$ export ALM_W-ARPA=./lm.arpa
```

- Example JSON format file

```json
{
  "size": 3,
  "debug": 1,
  "allow-unk": true,
  "interpolate": true,
  "method": "train",
  "w-map": "./lm.map",

```

> Sometimes it is necessary to change a word before it is added to ARPA - this can be done using the script [**wordTest.py**](https://github.com/anyks/alm#the-python-script-format-to-preprocess-the-received-words) the word and its context will be passed into script.

### Training using your own features

```bash
$ ./alm -alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя" -size 3 -smoothing wittenbell -method train -debug 1 -w-arpa ./lm.arpa -w-map ./lm.map -w-vocab ./lm.vocab -w-ngram ./lm.ngrams -allow-unk -interpolate -corpus ./corpus -ext txt -utokens "usa|russia" -utoken-script ./utokenTest.py
```

> The example adds its own features **usa** and **russia**, when processing text all words, that script [**utokenTest.py**](https://github.com/anyks/alm#the-python-script-format-to-define-the-word-features) marks as feature, will be added to ARPA with feature name.

```

> Here is the **rnum** token, which is a Roman number, but is not used as an independent token.

**Smoothing algorithm: Witten-Bell, assembly with all disabled tokens**
```bash
$ ./alm -alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя" -size 3 -smoothing wittenbell -method train -debug 1 -w-arpa ./lm.arpa -w-map ./lm.map -w-vocab ./lm.vocab -w-ngram ./lm.ngrams -allow-unk -reset-unk -interpolate -tokens-all-disable -corpus ./text.txt
```

> In the example, the identification of all tokens is disabled, disabled tokens will be added to ARPA as separate words.

### An example of identifying tokens as 〈unk〉

**Smoothing algorithm: Witten-Bell, assembly with identification of tokens as 〈unk〉**
```bash
$ ./alm -alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя" -size 3 -smoothing wittenbell -method train -debug 1 -w-arpa ./lm.arpa -w-map ./lm.map -w-vocab ./lm.vocab -w-ngram ./lm.ngrams -allow-unk -reset-unk -interpolate -tokens-unknown "num|url|abbr|date|time|anum|math|rnum|specl|range|aprox|score|dimen|fract|punct|isolat" -corpus ./text.txt
```

> Here is the **rnum** token, which is a Roman number, but is not used as an independent token.

**Smoothing algorithm: Witten-Bell, assembly with identification of all tokens as 〈unk〉**
```bash
$ ./alm -alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя" -size 3 -smoothing wittenbell -method train -debug 1 -w-arpa ./lm.arpa -w-map ./lm.map -w-vocab ./lm.vocab -w-ngram ./lm.ngrams -allow-unk -reset-unk -interpolate -tokens-all-unknown -corpus ./text.txt
```

> The example identifies all tokens as как 〈unk〉.

### Training using whitelist

```bash
$ ./alm -alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя" -size 3 -smoothing wittenbell -method train -debug 1 -w-arpa ./lm.arpa -w-map ./lm.map -w-vocab ./lm.vocab -w-ngram ./lm.ngrams -allow-unk -interpolate -corpus ./corpus -ext txt -goodwords ./goodwords.txt
```

> If you specify a whitelist during training, all words specified in the white list will be forcibly added to ARPA.

### Training using blacklist

```bash
$ ./alm -alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя" -size 3 -smoothing wittenbell -method train -debug 1 -w-arpa ./lm.arpa -w-map ./lm.map -w-vocab ./lm.vocab -w-ngram ./lm.ngrams -allow-unk -interpolate -corpus ./corpus -ext txt -badwords ./badwords.txt
```

> If you specify a black list during training, all the words indicated in the black list will be equated with the token **〈unk〉**.

### Training with an unknown word

```bash
./bin/alm.exe -alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя" -size 3 -smoothing wittenbell -method train -debug 1 -w-arpa ./lm.arpa -w-map ./lm.map -w-vocab ./lm.vocab -w-ngram ./lm.ngrams -allow-unk -interpolate -corpus ./corpus -ext txt -unknown-word goga
```

> In this example the token **〈unk〉** in ARPA will be replaced by the word specified in the parameter [-unknown-word | --unknown-word=〈value〉], in our case it's word **goga**.
